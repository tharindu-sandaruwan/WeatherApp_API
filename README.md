#Weather API - Spring Boot
This project is a secure Spring Boot REST API that provides weather data for a predefined list of cities. It leverages Spring Security with Auth0 for authentication and authorization, and implements a caching mechanism to optimize API responses.

##Features
1.Secure Endpoints: Uses Spring Security and OAuth 2.0 to protect the /weather endpoint.
2.Auth0 Integration: Authenticates users via Auth0, a third-party identity platform.
3.External API Integration: Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
4.Response Caching: Implements a 5-minute cache for weather data to reduce redundant external API calls and improve performance.
5.CORS Configuration: Pre-configured to allow requests from frontend applications running on localhost:5173 and localhost:3000.

##Configure Environment Variables
This project uses sensitive keys for connecting to Auth0 and OpenWeatherMap. It's best practice to manage these using environment variables rather than hardcoding them.

##Set Up Your Environment Variables
You now need to provide values for the properties defined in application.properties.
1.Get Auth0 Credentials:
  -Log in to your Auth0 Dashboard.
  -Go to Applications -> Applications and select your app (or create a new 'Regular Web Application').
  -In the Settings tab, you will find your Client ID and Client Secret.
  -The Issuer URI is your domain with a https:// prefix (e.g., https://dev-your-tenant.us.auth0.com/).
2.Get OpenWeatherMap API Key:(In this code, that API not configured in Environment variables)
  -Log in to your OpenWeatherMap Account.
  -You will find your default API key here.
3.Set the Variables:
  -The easiest way to set these for development is through your IDE's run configuration.
  -In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to Run -> Edit Configurations.... In the "Environment variables" field and add them.

##Configure Auth0 Application URLs
For the login and logout process to work correctly, you must configure the allowed URLs in your Auth0 Application settings.
  -Go to your application's Settings tab in the Auth0 Dashboard.
  -Find the Application URIs section.
  -Add the following URLs:
                          + Allowed Callback URLs: [http://localhost:5173/weather](http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/auth0)
                          + Allowed Logout URLs: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:8080/)
